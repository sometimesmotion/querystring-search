querystring-search
==================

Simple project for a search box plugin

#This is a very basic program, posted here purely to learn how to use Github

This is a JavaScript plugin to allow users to search for Creative Commons images in Flickr. It was created as a project 
to help teach about online searching, URL query strings, and introduce some basic concepts in HTML, JS, & jQuery. The project 
was developed as part of an Hour of Code event held at the Humboldt State University Library on Dec. 10th, 2014. 

The purpose of the project is to teach metaliteracy skills for information seeking [read more about metaliteracy in the 
article Reframing Information Literacy as a Metaliteracy by Thomas P. Mackey and Trudi E. Jacobson - 
http://crl.acrl.org/content/72/1/62.full.pdf+html]. The workshop can be viewed in two formats, a long-form and short-form. 
Both formats are archived as Mozilla Webmaker Thimble Lessons: 
Teaching Kit: https://millrt138.makes.org/thimble/LTExMTM3ODQwNjQ=/exploring-url-query-strings
Long-form (1.5-2 hours, 3 parts): https://millrt138.makes.org/thimble/LTU5MzY5MDM2OA==/part-1-anatomy-of-a-url
Short-form (1 hour, 2 parts): https://millrt138.makes.org/thimble/LTE3MTY5MTE4NzI=/part-a-anatomy-of-a-url
The short form is also available with embedded JSBin code snippets for practicing basic concepts:
